This is the beginning of the journey. I have never been so 
interested in a line of studies and I never thought that 
today, at 33, this would be possible.

I am extremely focused and excited about this new “restart” 
of my career, but aware that it was all my baggage and 
experiences that brought me so much desire and determination 
to go beyond what I can imagine today.

It only took an opportunity, a desire for change and the 
right friendships to this beginning.

I will always remember that.
